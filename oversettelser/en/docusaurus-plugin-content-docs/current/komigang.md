The Norwegian Tax Administration offers a range of standardized APIs that can be used by Norwegian public or private organizations. Documentation for these APIs is gathered on this website. We are continuously working to make more APIs available.

In this section, you can find technical information that applies across the Norwegian Tax Administration’s APIs, for example documentation about:

* [Security incluing Maskinporten](./om/sikkerhet.md)
* [System user](./om/systembruker.md)
* [Delegation](./om/delegering.md)
* [Access packages](./om/rettighetspakker.md) 

Information about services and solutions that are under development or in pilot can be found on the [Beta page](https://skatteetaten.github.io/beta-apier/).

APIs from the National Population Register are documented on [a separate GitHub page](https://skatteetaten.github.io/folkeregisteret-api-dokumentasjon/om-tjenestene/).

## Access to APIs from the Norwegian Tax Administration

To be able to use the Norwegian Tax Administration’s APIs, you must have been granted access to the specific APIs. The process for obtaining access varies between the different APIs and is described in more detail in the relevant use case area or in the API documentation. Some requirements apply in all cases:
* The organization requesting access must have a Norwegian organization number
* The organization must be onboarded to Maskinporten
* The Norwegian Tax Administration must have granted the organization access to the API

## Use Cases

Each API has its own documentation and is grouped in the left-hand menu under "API-er for deling" and "API-er for innrapportering".

In addition, we have collected documentation that bundles APIs for specific areas or across APIs, referred to as "Anvendelsesområder" (Use cases):
* [A-meldingen](./anvendelsesomraader/ameldingen.md)
* [Sharing data from from the Norwegian Tax Administration](./anvendelsesomraader/deling-skatteetaten.md)
* [Reporting third-party data](./anvendelsesomraader/innrapportering-tredjepartsopplysninger.md)
* [Claims and payments](./anvendelsesomraader/kravogbetalinger.md)
* [VAT return](./anvendelsesomraader/mvamelding.md)
* [The tax return](./anvendelsesomraader/skattemelding.md)
* [Tax deduction cards for employers](./anvendelsesomraader/skattekorttilarbeidsgiver.md)
