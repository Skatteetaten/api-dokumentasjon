<Summary>APIs Related to the VAT Return (English version) </Summary>

## VAT Modernization
In 2022, the VAT return was modernized. The new VAT return now provides better compliance, more equal competition conditions, simplification for businesses, and more efficient administration.
Some simplifications are a direct result of the changes in the VAT return. There are fewer sources of error, easier refunds, and it becomes simpler to fulfill the reporting obligations.

It also enables guidance and dialogue through, for example, validation before submission and reminders of tasks via a task list.
In addition, there is a desire to offer increased access to lookups and insights to achieve efficiency and confidence through digital reconciliation.
The new return also improves interaction between accounting systems and Altinn/The Norwegian Tax Administration, for example through automatic receipts sent to the accounting system.
